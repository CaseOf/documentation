The files extension indexes the files in the given directory by their name.

> TODO be more specific

Further the files extension provides a way to browse through paths that are _not_ indexed. Queries that begin with either `/` or `~/` are interpreted as a beginning of a path and the extension lists the files in this directory. In combination with the tab completions this is a nice way to browse the file system.
