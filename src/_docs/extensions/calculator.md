**Note**: This extension depends on [muparser](http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=muparser).

The calculator should be self-explanatory. The calculator item appears as soon as you type a valid math expression into the input box. Euler's number `_e` and Ï€ `_pi` are predefined. For the available predefined operators and functions check the [muparser documentation](http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=muparser&hl=en&p=features&s=idDef1#idDef1).
