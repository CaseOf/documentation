### Do not complain about anything

Here should be a pretty and elaborate landing page for Albert, but actually I think my time is better invested in pushing Albert :D

Access everything with virtually zero effort. Run applications, open files or their paths, open bookmarks in your browser, search the web, calculate things and a lot more ...

Albert is a desktop agnostic launcher. Its goals are usability and beauty, performance and extensability. It is written in C++ and based on the Qt framework.

GPL-licensed, 100% free and open source.
